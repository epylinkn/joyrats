## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with a Webpack2/Express/Heroku Starter.

### Webpack2/Express/Heroku Starter

This is a very basic sample app to get you started using [Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and is setup to deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

Features:

* [HMR](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)

## Setup

- `npm i`
- `npm start`
- Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Deploy

First, you'll need a heroku account.

- In Heroku, create a new app.
- Add a new buildpack, select `heroku/nodejs`. This should set you up to automatically run `npm install` which is what you'll need to get up and running.
- Follow the instructions to [link to your repository](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).
- `git push heroku master` - Assuming you've set everything up correctly, this will deploy your app, and run the postinstall script in `package.json`.

## Deployment

Configure your heroku remote and then simply:

```
git push heroku
```
